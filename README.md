### Python-Requests-API
In this project, I have learnt how to make requests using Requests module in Python. I have also saved the list of all the courses in file.json file.

### Requirements

Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python. Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. You can install requests library using following code in your terminal in Linux.

    pip3 install requests

### Instructions to run the code
If you want to run the code in Linux, open your terminal and type- python3 api.py


##  In javascript node

### Axios
SARAL is the eLearning platform of NavGurukul, which is available on website [SARAL](http://saral.navgurukul.org). I have created a CLI based app where users can access the content of saral using the terminal.

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node's http interface.

### Requirements and Installation
If you're using Windows, go through the official site of Nodejs to install it. For Linux-based OS, proceed with the following commands on your terminal.

    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install axios --save
You do also need to install fs (File System) to access physical file system, like reading and writing files. To install run the given commands in your terminal.

        npm install fs --save
To run your code, first open your server port using node file_name.js in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
